This README outlines the development steps taken to create an appointment system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), with MySQL as the database. The purpose of this document is to show the sequential steps and progress of the project.
Development Progress
Step 1: Initial Setup

    Date Completed: 1 MAR 2025
    Tasks Done:
        Set up the initial GitHub repository.
        Created local directories for front-end and back-end code.
        Initialized npm and installed necessary packages like Express, MySQL, React, and Axios.

Step 2: Backend Setup

    Date Completed: 2 MAR 2025
    Tasks Done:
        Developed the basic server using Node.js and Express.
        Configured MySQL database connection.
        Created the appointments table in the database.
        Implemented REST API endpoints for creating and retrieving appointments.

Step 3: Frontend Setup

    Date Completed: 3 MAR 2025
    Tasks Done:
        Set up the React application structure.
        Created AppointmentForm component to handle the form submissions.
        Used Axios for sending HTTP requests to the backend.


Step 4: Final Testing and Debugging

    Date Completed: 4 MAR 2025
    Tasks Done:
        Conducted thorough testing across different modules.
        Made final adjustments to CSS for better UI/UX.

Step 5: Appointment Style

    Date Completed: 5 MAR 2025
    Tasks Done:
        Made and applied styles to the Appointment Form in React to make it look better.
        Improved the design of inputs, textarea, and buttons to make them easier to use.
        Made sure the form looks good on different devices with responsive design.       

How to Run Locally
Prerequisites

    MySQL Server

Running the Application

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/appointment-system.git
cd appointment-system

Backend setup:

cd backend
npm install
node server.js

Frontend setup:

cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
